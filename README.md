# IntroTextGame

###Description###
I wanted to create my own text based game as I was an avid fan of them growing up.
I have created a setup and very small intro for it. The game is based on a player waking up on the shore of a beach. Run from eclipse or spring tool suite, etc.

##Technologies Used##
* If statements

* while loops

* Ascii

* Getters and Setters

#Lessons Learned#

* Implementing colors and background colors for text

* Aligning Ascii art, resizing and getting the background to display only in the locations I wanted it to be in.

* Make sure to call the setter before trying to use the getter.

#Improvements To Be Made#

* Expand Story

* Some form of combat

* Ascii Art Map Of Player Movement

* A way to save game state and resume where you left off
